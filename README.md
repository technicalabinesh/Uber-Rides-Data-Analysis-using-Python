# 🚕 **Uber Rides Data Analysis using Python**

## 📘 **Overview**
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on historical Uber ride data to uncover ride trends, demand patterns, and time-based insights using Python-based data tools.

---

## 🎯 **Project Goals**
- Understand user ride behaviors
- Analyze patterns in time, location, and frequency
- Identify peak demand hours and days
- Visualize insights for better decision-making

---

## 📁 **Dataset Details**
- The dataset includes Uber pickups with fields like:
  - **Date/Time**
  - **Latitude/Longitude**
  - **Base Codes**
